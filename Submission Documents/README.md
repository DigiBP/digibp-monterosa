FHNW School of Business Onboarding Process


The overall process that is digitised within this module is the FHNW School of Business Onboarding Process. This process includes two sub-processes, the "Recommend Study Program" process and the "Program Registration" Process. As the "Program Registration" process is being digitised within an ongoing project by the School of Business, the main focus in this module lies on the "Recommend Study Program" process.

The FHNW SChoolf of Business Onboarding Process leads potential students of the School of Business from the first interest in being a student to the actual admission in a program. In the sub-process "Recommend Study Program", the interested person is supported in choosing a program that matches his/her skills, interests and life-style. Also, the person can then participate in tests that enforce his/her choice. As soon as the interested person decides to register for the recommended program, the second sub-process, the "Program Registration" process, is triggered.

"Recommend Study Program" as-is process:
Currently, there is only the sub-process "Program Registration" existant. There is no support for prospective students to decide for a program. As the overall onboarding process is going through some changes and digitalization steps, this is a good moment re-design the process and add the step of programm recommendations.
