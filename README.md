FHNW School of Business Onboarding Process


The overall process that is digitised within this module is the FHNW School of Business Onboarding Process. This process includes two sub-processes, the "Recommend Study Program" process and the "Program Registration" Process. As the "Program Registration" process is being digitised within an ongoing project by the School of Business, the main focus in this module lies on the "Recommend Study Program" process.
